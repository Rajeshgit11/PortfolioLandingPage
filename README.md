## Introduction
This project is a **personal portfolio landing page** built using **HTML and CSS**. It was created as part of a front-end development challenge to practice structuring web pages, styling layouts, and organizing content using **Flexbox**.
The page introduces who I am, highlights my work, and demonstrates core front-end skills such as responsive design, clean layout structure, and interactive UI elements—similar to what you’d expect on a real developer’s website.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**
  - Built using semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`)
  - Includes links for Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact
  - Hover effects for interactivity

- **Hero Section**
  - Welcome message and brief personal introduction
  - Profile image with rounded corners
  - Distinct background color to stand out visually

- **Projects Section**
  - Displays three project cards
  - Each card includes an image, title, and short description
  - Flexbox layout for side-by-side alignment
  - Hover animation and box-shadow for polish

- **Footer**
  - Contains Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and Contact Info
  - Clean, consistent styling with hover effects

- **Responsive Design**
  - Media queries ensure the layout adapts for smaller screens
  - Navigation and project cards stack appropriately on mobile devices
